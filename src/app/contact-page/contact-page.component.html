            <p>
                My name is Elisa and I was born in 1992, in Italy.
                Since I was kid, Fantasy world inspired me to draw.
                I have always tried to keep pushing my limits as self-taught person and, growing up, I have never abandoned this passion.
                Instead, I have strengthen it with love for nerd world!
                <br><br>
                Why did I enter the T-Shirt world? Well, because design and nerf world have synergy!
